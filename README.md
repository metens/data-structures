# Data Structures Practice
This is a repo where I practice my data structures in C++.

## Types of Data Structures
In this repo, you will find folders for **linear linked lists,
doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, binary trees,
arrays of linked lists, linked lists of arrays**, and much more.

## Tasks
So far I am starting at linear linked lists. Here is a task list
that I plan to move through in the next month:

- [X] linear linked lists
- [X] doubly linked lists
- [ ] circular linked lists
- [ ] binary search trees
- [ ] \(more coming soon)
